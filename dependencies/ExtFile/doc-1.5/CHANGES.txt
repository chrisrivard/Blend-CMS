1.5.6
- Made sure stream_iterator closes the stream even if it has not
  been fully consumed.
- Added tests for _get_content_type and the HTTPUpload helper.
- Added a ZCML layer for running tests under Zope >= 2.9.
- 280+ unit tests.

1.5.4
- Store maxx and maxy used to create a given preview for cases
  where we need to regenerate it (PUT).
- No longer allow manage_http_upload to regenerate previews.
- Don't break getIconPath if the content_type is malformed or empty.
- Added a NORMALIZE_CASE repository option that lowercases directory
  names. This makes for prettier static URLs and aids cross-filesystem
  portability of the repository.
- Added a CUSTOM repository option that determines the directory
  structure by calling a user-defined CUSTOM_METHOD. Thanks to
  Markus Krainer.
- 260+ unit tests.

1.5.2
- Support OFS.Cacheable API to work with HTTP cache managers.
- Return a stream iterator instead of writing to the RESPONSE.
  This speeds up ExtFile/ExtImage serving significantly, making
  it faster than the standard File and Image.
- Filename-to-id translation now supports utf-8 in addition
  to latin-1.
- 240+ unit tests

1.5.0
- Made sure 304 responses return a RFC1123 date.
- 200+ unit tests.

1.5.0-beta1
- No longer use an acquired REQUEST in ExtFile.index_html().
- No longer mangle extensions of unknown binary files.
- Switched to Zope 2.8 transactions and an all new TM strategy.
- Fixed a bug in manage_upload() which didn't have tests.
- Factory methods now return the id.
- Renamed icon_html to icon_tag, preview_html to preview_tag.
- Implemented PrincipiaSearchSource for text/* files.
- Counter in file names now separated from name by a dot.
- Colon, single- and double-quote added to bad_chars list.
- Fixed tag() method to use icon url if there is no preview.
- 190+ unit tests.

1.4.4
- Fixed missing import of TemporaryFile.
- Fixed support for the Photo product which was broken in 1.4.2.
  Note that you cannot use ZODB_PATH = PHYSICAL with Photos!
- Images using the CMYK color model are converted to RGB
  before computing the preview. Thanks to Jan-Wijbrand Kolman.
- 130+ unit tests.

1.4.2
- Fixed an RFC violation. See http://collector.zope.org/Zope/544.
- Fixed no-context detection in Zope 2.7.
- Fixed repository umask for generated previews.
- Stopped _createPreview() from swallowing PIL exceptions.
- SYNC_ZODB can now use the physical path (see Config.py).
- Bundled Bjorn Nelson's extFile_load_site.sh utility, that
  can be used to bulk-upload data into ExtFiles/ExtImages.
- 120 unit tests.

1.4.0
- ExtFile/ExtImage now have interfaces properly declared.
- ExtFile/ExtImage are now transaction-aware. File operations
  are performed using temporary files, which are "committed"
  (or removed) at the end of the transaction. This makes sure
  repository files are only created/modified if the transaction
  completes successfully.
- 100+ unit tests.

This release was sponsored by Infrae and ETH Zurich. The 
initial implementation came from Christian Zagrodnick of gocept.
Thanks for making this possible.
