2.0
- Dropped support for Zope < 2.9.6.
- Use logging instead of deprecated zLOG.
- Use extfile.ini instead of Config.py for configuration.
  Copy the example to INSTANCE_HOME/etc/extfile.ini if you want to
  make modifications.
- The [mimetypes] section in extfile.ini can be used to override
  content-type -> extension mappings for cases where the system does
  not guess right.
- Use event subscribers instead of manage_before/after hooks.
- Thanks to events, repository files are now renamed when the ZODB
  objects are renamed and moved when the ZODB objects are moved.
- Replaced manage_afterUpdate with ExtFileUpdated and ExtImageUpdated
  events respectively.
- Dropped support for the Photo product.
- Removed ugly colons from ZMI screens.
- Added preview_link and thumbnail_tag methods to IExtImage.
- Bugfix: Exceptions at a late stage of a cut/paste operation could
  lead to data loss.
- Bugfix: If-Modified-Since didn't work if the time passed was equal
  to _p_mtime. Thanks to Daniel Nouri.
