      Chris Withers       -- Development work and improved

      Gerhard Wannemacher -- Patch to cater for ZSQL methods which
                             return uppercase column names.

  Version 1.1.1

    - Fixed bug that prevented new Simple User Folder instances
      registering with the security machinery.

    - Improvements to the testing framework to cater for encrypted
      passwords and user folders that don't want to support arbitary
      extra attributes for their users.

    - Compatible with Zope 2.7. These changes were purely to the 
      testing framework.

  Version 1.1.0

    - Added the ability to give users extra attributes.
      These are accessed by supplying them in
      getUserDetails and then using the user's __getitem__
      interface.

    - Changed case of NAME, PASSWORD and ROLE to
      name, password and role for Z SQL implementations

    - Made Simple User Folder instances ObjectManagers.
      This means configuration methods can now be put in
      the Simpler User Folder, rather than the 
      Simple User Folder's container

    - Renamed 'getUserNames' configuration method to
      'getUserIds' to avoid a name clash brought on
      by the addition of ObjectManager functionality

    - Catered for getUserDetails raising an exception or 
      returning rubbish in a graceful way

    - Documented and tested for the case where editUser is 
      called with a password of None

    - Enabled UsageBase class to test implementations that
      stored encrypted passwords

    - Tidied up tests, SQL tests in particular
